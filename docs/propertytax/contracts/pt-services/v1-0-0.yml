  # All API's are POST. _create,_search,_update for post,get and put. RequestInfo will be part of body. For multiple records we can pass multiple value with comman seperated values*.
  # All _search will be synchronous and all _create and _update will be asynchronous*.
  # RequestInfo and ResponseInfo object should be reffered from Common*.
  # In _search API, tenantId should be passed in query param. In _create/_update, tenantId should be passed in the model.
  # Readonly means that even if these fields are passed in the request, it will be ignored in create/update and will not be added/updated in the entities. The readonly fields might be passed to the _search API's to make use of fields for the search Query API. while calling _search API's even mandatory fields might not be available, it is mandatory only in the _create API's*.
  # All errors will be returned with HTTP error code 400 with customized error code and messages. Consumer of the API need to handle 400 with customized error code and message.
  # Definition must start with Upper case followed by camel case.
  # Every model will have tenantId. Validate tenantId on create.
  # Parameter name must start with small case followed by camel case.
  # Path must be in small case.
