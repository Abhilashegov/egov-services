            name given for budget in the tree structure. Generally Tree structure
            consist of 3 levels : 1. Root level : which is basically defined as
            RE-2017-18 or BE-2017-18 which defines the budget type and the financial
            year. 2. Account type level : which is defined under root level which
            will be combination of root level and account type - Revenue and Capital.
            Ex : "RE-Rev-2017-18" 3. Department wise : which is defined under budget
            type level which will be combination of root level, account type and
            department. Ex : "ACC-Rev-RE-2017-18" and then the budget detail under
